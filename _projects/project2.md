**Correlated Topic Model (CTM) to organize genes in the human genome.**
	I sought to improve upon prior efforts to use topic models to model genetic expression using RNA-seq data. Past work used methods like Latent Dirichlet Allocation, which involve a generative process in which topics are independent of one another. I hypothesized that when trying to use a topic model to organize genes into topics, this assumption would likely not stand. As such, I implemented a Correlated Topic Model from scratch using Variational EM, and showed that it could discover interesting and relevant topics. Implementation done in Python with Numpy.
