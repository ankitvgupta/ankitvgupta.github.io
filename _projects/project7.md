**LSTMs to build a predictive model for user behavior on iOS.**
 We take advantage of a simple vector for a potential side-channel attack in iOS 10: Safari allows websites to request accelerometer data from users without requesting any additional permissions. We show that this data can be used to ascertain, with reasonably high probability, what a user is doing at the time (walking, running, going up stairs, etc.). Collaboration with Ezra Zigmond.
