**Protein secondary structure prediction using LSTM-based maximum entropy markov model.**
 We were interested in developing models for protein secondary structure directly from the protein sequence. Given an input protein sequence, we sought to predict the secondary structure label at each position. We used a number of state-of-the-art sequential processing techniques, ranging from simple maximum entropy markov models to Bidirectional LSTMs. Implementation was done in Torch. Collaboration with Tom Silver. [[code]](https://github.com/ankitvgupta/CS287assignments/tree/master/finalproject)
