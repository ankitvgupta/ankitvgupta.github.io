**Predicting regulatory markers using dilated convolutional neural networks [Thesis].**
 This work uses deep learning to predict the locations of regulatory markers in the human genome. The markers include transcription factor binding sites, histone modifications, and DNAse hypersensitivity sites. I had noticed that prior work in this area only considered short sequences of DNA, where were generally 1000 base-pairs or less. However, due to DNA's complex three-dimensional conformation, there exists dependencies on the scale of several thousands, or even millions, of base-pairs in the genome that would likely be relevant to predicting regulatory marker locations. To address this, I proposed an architecture using dilated convolutional neural networks, which had prevously been used for image segmentation and text-to-speech to build a predictive model for regulatory markers. This model was more effective than past techniques at labeling regulatory markers across the entire human genome. Implemention done in Python using Tensorflow.
