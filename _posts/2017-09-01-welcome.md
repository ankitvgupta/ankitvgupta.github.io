Welcome to my personal blog! I'm hoping to use this blog to organize my thoughts and share work that I find interesting. You'll mostly find me talking about machine learning, but I also enjoy reading about biology, foreign policy, and a variety of other random subjects. To learn more about my background, check out my [home page](/), where you can see examples of my past publications and projects. 

If you have any suggestions for improving this page, or if you just want to chat, please [reach out](/contact)! I'm currently based out of the San Francisco Bay Area.
