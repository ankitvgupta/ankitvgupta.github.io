I have an exciting development: I decided to join some friends in starting a company! We are [Reverie Labs](http://www.reverielabs.com), and we are using machine learning to accelerate drug discovery. My co-founders [Jonah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonah-kallenbach-5a306985/) and [Connor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cvduffy/) have been working on this idea for a few months, and I have now joined them full-time.

We are using a variety of machine learning techniques to build models of chemical and biological phenomena, and are motivated to use these methods to alleviate several of the key bottlenecks in drug discovery. Ultimately, this will allow us to deliver drugs to the market more quickly. If you are involved with the pharmaceutical industry and are interested in chatting, please [reach out](/contact) via email or Twitter. 

I intend to keep blogging about developments in machine learning, along with some of my experiences in building a company.
