## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="ankit.jpg">

Hi! I am a recent graduate of Harvard University, where I earned a joint BA/MS in Computer Science. I graduated magna cum lauda with highest honors, and was inducted in Phi Beta Kappa. In my final two years, I worked with Alexander Rush in the Harvard NLP Group on deep learning over sequential data. 

For my thesis, I used Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks to improve regulatory marker predictive accuracy on a whole-genome labeling task. This work was accepted to the ICML 2017 Workshop in Computational Biology, where I was also invited to give a talk, and received a speaker award and best poster award.

## Research Interest

I'm primarily interested in developing widely-applicable machine learning models. My existing research experiences have spanned a variety of machine learning domains, including bayesian inference and deep learning. I'm particularly interested in problem domains that pose unique data constraints. For examples, genomics datasets tend to be much sparser and have longer-distance dependencies than comparable sequential datasets in natural language processing. I'm interested in understanding how these unique constraints limit the efficacy of existing models, and in building models that are robust to them.

## Teaching 

While I was a student at Harvard, I had the opportunity to be a teaching fellow for a variety of courses. This role involved helping write problem sets, teaching sections, holding office hours, leading course-wide review sessions, and grading.
